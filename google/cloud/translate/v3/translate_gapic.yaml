    # A list of method configurations.
    # Common properties:
    #
    #   name - The simple name of the method.
    #
    #   flattening - Specifies the configuration for parameter flattening.
    #   Describes the parameter groups for which a generator should produce method
    #   overloads which allow a client to directly pass request message fields as
    #   method parameters. This information may or may not be used, depending on
    #   the target language.
    #   Consists of groups, which each represent a list of parameters to be
    #   flattened. Each parameter listed must be a field of the request message.
    #
    #   required_fields - Fields that are always required for a request to be
    #   valid.
    #
    #   page_streaming - Specifies the configuration for paging.
    #   Describes information for generating a method which transforms a paging
    #   list RPC into a stream of resources.
    #   Consists of a request and a response.
    #   The request specifies request information of the list method. It defines
    #   which fields match the paging pattern in the request. The request consists
    #   of a page_size_field and a token_field. The page_size_field is the name of
    #   the optional field specifying the maximum number of elements to be
    #   returned in the response. The token_field is the name of the field in the
    #   request containing the page token.
    #   The response specifies response information of the list method. It defines
    #   which fields match the paging pattern in the response. The response
    #   consists of a token_field and a resources_field. The token_field is the
    #   name of the field in the response containing the next page token. The
    #   resources_field is the name of the field in the response containing the
    #   list of resources belonging to the page.
    #
    #   retry_codes_name - Specifies the configuration for retryable codes. The
    #   name must be defined in interfaces.retry_codes_def.
    #
    #   retry_params_name - Specifies the configuration for retry/backoff
    #   parameters. The name must be defined in interfaces.retry_params_def.
    #
    #   field_name_patterns - Maps the field name of the request type to
    #   entity_name of interfaces.collections.
    #   Specifies the string pattern that the field must follow.
    #
    #   timeout_millis - Specifies the default timeout for a non-retrying call. If
    #   the call is retrying, refer to retry_params_name instead.
